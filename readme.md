#Coin Collect
A simple 2 player platforming game in which each player tries to collect as many coins as possible before the timer ends. The players must jump from platform to platform and run into a coin to add 1 point to the player's score. One player uses the arrow keys to move and the other uses ASWD. The player who has collected the most coins wins.
